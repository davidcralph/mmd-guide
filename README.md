# mmd-guide
A simple guide to freeware animation program MikuMikuDance (MMD)

This guide is a work-in-progress.

## About
I've been working on a large project featuring Hatsune Miku and various other VOCALOID characters for some time. To do this project, I've needed to render and create custom 3D animations. However,
as a student I don't have the time to learn how to use programs such as Blender. I found a program commonly used for this purpose named MikuMikuDance (MMD). Although intuitive to use and incredibly
useful, the issue with MMD I find is the lack of easily understandable up-to-date documentation and active maintenance. After spending many hours searching the web trying to solve problems and eventually becoming
somewhat decent at the program, I decided to write this guide partially as reference for myself in case I forget how to do something, and also to help people who are new to MMD or haven't
used it in a long time. 

The goal for this documentation site are to be entirely free and editable by all with community feedback, and to be easily understandable.
