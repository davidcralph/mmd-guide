# Downloading Content
When browsing MMD content, you will almost always notice the inclusion of custom assets. These can include motions, models and stages. This tutorial will tell you how to download and use
content for your MMD animations. Please note, if you do not know how to import content read the "Navigating MMD" guide.

There are various different websites with MMD content freely available.

## BowlRoll
Probably the most popular service, BowlRoll is a Japanese website allowing creators to share their 3D models, motions, VSQs and various other VOCALOID-related resources. You can download
all content freely from this site. Unfortunately, the website has no English support so you will need to use Google Translate in your browser if you don't understand Japanese.

For example, if you wanted to download Tda's Miku model, you would do the following:

* Firstly, visit the BowlRoll page [here](https://bowlroll.net/file/4576).
* Next, click "Download" (you may need an account for some files, this is free)
* Unzip the downloaded file

And that's it!

*However*, you may notice a text field next to the download button preventing you from downloading the file. See the [passwords](#passwords) section in this guide to find out more.

You may also notice some files say "Expired". This means distribution of this resource has been ended by the creator (it may be timed, or another reason) and you will not be able to 
get it anymore.

## Warnings
There are various things you must consider before using MMD content.
* Respect the creators wishes - rules for resources are often in a readme.txt file or on the description/website. For example, if they don't want you to use it for commercial purposes, don't
* Try to list resources used in your video - links to models etc, and if you've forgotten even the creator's name is acceptable. It is common practice on YouTube and niconico to credit resources used so even if
the readme doesn't state it as requirement, it is still a nice thing to do
* Do not redistribute commercial models (e.g Saboten's MAYU) - this is illegal
* Copyright issues - Refrain from using ripped motions or models, for example from games such as Project Diva. These are always done without SEGA or the companies permission and it is illegal to use them, as well as bad
practice (keywords to avoid: PDFT, Rip, HMVR, PDXHD, PDF2ND, PD etc). The best way to tell this is if the motion credit mentions a company like SEGA, Marza Animation Planet, Bandai Namco or Crypton Future Media
* If you don't know the terms and conditions of using a resource, don't use it (and remember that Google Translate isn't always accurate!)
