# Introduction
Welcome to the tutorials section! These will help you to do various things in MMD, such as creating hologram-ready videos.

I (David Ralph) will be adding tutorials for things I'm using, but you are very welcome to write your own and submit them to this repository. These guides
assume you already have decent knowledge of MikuMikuDance and other programs mentioned on this website.
